# Heart Disease Prediction Model 
This is fullstack application that can make prediction based on patient medical data. Design made by Sasha Gurievich(thx a lot!).

## How you can start it?
*Step 1*: Clone repository to your computer  
*Step 2*: Install all dependencies for backend, use **npm install** from **C:\yourPath\HeartDiseaseV2>** directory   
*Step 3*: Open new terminal  
*Step 4*: in new terminal go to "hear_disease" directory, use in your terminal **C:\yourPath\HeartDiseaseV2>cd front** command, after use **C:\yourPath\HeartDiseaseV2\front>cd hear_disese** command  
*Step 5*: Install all dependencies for frontend, use **npm install** from **C:\yourPath\HeartDiseaseV2\front\hear_disease**  
*Step 6*: Start the local client server use **npm start** from **C:\yourPath\HeartDiseaseV2\front\hear_disease**   
*Step 7*: Go back the first terminal and use **npm start** to start the backend server  
*Step 8*: You can use this data to test application:

Maximum heart rate achived - 150  
Angina induced by exercise - No  
Exercise induced ST-depression - 2,3  
ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise - upsloping  
The number of major vessels - 0
